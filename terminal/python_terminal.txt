14.49
14.49 The conflict is caused by:
14.49     The user requested packaging==25.0
14.49     matplotlib 3.10.3 depends on packaging>=20.0
14.49     prefect 3.4.1 depends on packaging<25.1 and >=21.3
14.49     streamlit 1.45.1 depends on packaging<25 and >=20
14.49
14.49 To fix this you could try to:
14.49 1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
14.49 2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

Looks like you're deploying to a process work pool. If you're creating a deployment for local development, calling 
`.serve` on your flow is a great way to get started. See the documentation for more information:
https://docs.prefect.io/latest/deploy/run-flows-in-local-processes  Set `ignore_warnings=True` to suppress this message.  
Successfully created/updated all deployments!

To execute flow runs from this deployment, start a worker in a separate terminal that pulls work from the 'scrape-news'   
work pool:

        $ prefect worker start --pool 'scrape-news'

To schedule a run for this deployment, use the following command:

        $ prefect deployment run 'scrape-news-flow-2/scrape-news'


You can also run your flow via the Prefect UI: http://server:4200/deployments/deployment/2999ce90-f6ae-444b-9722-643412db4cd3
