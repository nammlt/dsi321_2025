"New, 'Living' Building Material Made From Fungi and Bacteria Could Pave the Way to Self-Healing Structures",,"Researchers are developing the biomaterial as a more environmentally friendly alternative to concrete, but any wide-scale use is still far away"
Fungus-based material could offer a sustainable concrete alternative,,"Among the many things we could do to reduce strain on the environment is find greener ways of constructing buildings. You see, cement production accounts for 8% of CO2 emissions worldwide - and a lot of that goes towards making concrete."
Eco-voxels: Researchers pioneer reconfigurable building blocks for Earth and off-world construction,,"For centuries, innovations in structural materials have prioritized strength and durability—often at a steep environmental price. Today, the construction industry accounts for approximately 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions,"
Iron-fortified lumber could be a greener alternative to steel beams,,"Although lumber does show promise as a renewable alternative to structural materials such as steel and concrete, it still tends to be a bit weaker than those substances. Scientists have now set ..."
Sustainable building materials company launches fire-retardant plywood,,"Developed for fire-resilient, code-compliant materials, T2Earth's OnWood Plywood is independently certified by the International Code Council and exceeds performance standards for both structural integrity and fire safety."
Materials for Building Houses,,"The ;auses which operate against this are the high price of building lots and materials for building with. Timber Is becoming dearer every yrear, and will continue to do so. Bricks are tiigh in ..."
"Why stone wool insulation offers alternative for home construction, remodels",,"Due to modern advances in technology, the products used in the building material supply are evolving ... there is normally no alternative but the trash. When making decisions on your next ..."
Council considering construction debris recycling site,,"The City of LaGrange is considering a rezoning change to allow for a company to operate a construction debris remediation site near the airport. If approved, the reclamation site would be located on 28."
"Eco Material Opening Queens Terminal to Bring 50,000 Tons of Low Carbon Cement Replacement Products Into New York City Metro Annually",,"Eco Material Technologies (""Eco Material"" or the ""Company""), the leading producer, marketer and distributor of supplementary cementitious materials (""SCMs"") and producer of green cement products in North America,"
Adaptavate secures £2.7 million in a pre-Series A round to accelerate global scale-up of low-carbon construction technology,,"Adaptavate, a global pioneer in developing and industrialising low-carbon and carbon-negative construction materials, has successfully raised £2.7 million in a pre-Series A funding round. Asia-based investor Undivided Ventures and European VC arm Skreenhouse Ventures by SigmaRoc have made significant investments,"
